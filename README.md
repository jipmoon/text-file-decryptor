# text-file-decryptor

---- COMPILE AND RUN ON THE COMMAND LINE ----
If you know how to compile programs on the command line, and if you have
downloaded the code, you can easily compile and run all the examples.
Use the command

                  make
                  
to compile all the examples from that code.  
Then, you should be seeing console messages something like this:

                  Compiling decrypt.c . . .
                  gcc -c -g decrypt.c
                  Linking main . . .

After seeing the above messages, use the command

                  ./main input.txt output.txt

Go to the project directory, and you should be able to see the decrypted outputs in output.txt
